# LeetScraper
- Just a fun little mini project I did in the middle of the night 
- Just provide a leetcode problem link as an argument -> And it creates a dev suite for you to write code in your favourite IDE, if you don't like using the web one
- Provides problem description and all example test cases 
- If you'd like anything else added, feel free to do it yourself (It's not too hard, I wrote this while playing league on my second monitor - so the code won't be the best)
- Or contact me if you'd like : mohamed131927@gmail.com | sogood#079 on discord
